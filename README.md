# My Awesome Project
I don't know if you were lucky enough to get the actual pokédex toy but I spent an ungodly amount of time playing with it. It didn't even talk, but mine does!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PokeAPI

This uses a mix of HTML and CSS to position the pokédex graphic, paired with javascript to make calls to the PokeAPI. The PokeAPI contains an absolute ton of data, really puts other APIs to shame. It has every single description for the pokémon throughout every game they exist in. It's crazy.

## Optimizations

As mentioned above, there is so much to do with the API that while this reflects pretty well the Gen 1 pokédex I am working on expanding it to reflect the latest pokédex from the anime which provides a lot more data. I would like this to work as an accompaniment to actually playing the games, rather than having to google for breeding or catching information you could just search here.

## Lessons Learned:

The API has deep pockets and it was legitimately really engaging to work with, as it had a lot of data, some in odd formats that had to be iterated through and parsed out for just what I needed.
